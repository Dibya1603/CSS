            ollowing the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of American comic books featuring superheroes,Comics created new superhero characters. 
            Stan Lee developed the initial concept for Iron Man.
             He wanted to design a character who should be unpalatable to his generally anti-war readers but to make them like the character anyway.
              Iron Man was created in the years after a permanent arms industry developed in the United States,
               and this was incorporated into the character's backstory.

               Lee described the national mood toward Vietnam during Iron Man's creation as 
               "a time when most of us genuinely felt that the conflict in that tortured land really was a simple matter of good versus evil".
